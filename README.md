# FindRestaurantsByZIP
This Android application helps users find restaurants by entering a zip code. The first screen provides a simple interface where users can input a zip code to begin their search. Upon submitting, the second screen appears, featuring a search bar at the top and a list of restaurants below it. Users can filter or scroll through the restaurants based on the zip code entered. The UI is designed for ease of use, with smooth navigation between the search and result screens.
